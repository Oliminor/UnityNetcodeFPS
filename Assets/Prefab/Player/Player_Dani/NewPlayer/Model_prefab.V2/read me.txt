Model 2.1 = 3d model rigged with target, weapons, animator and animator controller script.

**Model 2.2 = Model with Parent object and all the original componets from capsule_player_model.

**Creating a prefab of Model2.2 and placing it on the scene breaks the movement of the object(player). 
**In other words, you can't move any instance of the Model2.2 anymore unless prefab is removed from the scene.
